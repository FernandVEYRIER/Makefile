.SH SYNOPSIS
maker [BIN NAME] [OPTIONS]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
Maker will help you to create a Makefile and includes very quickly, especially for big projects. This command will look recursively from your current repository and find all the C files, which will be added to the sources of the Makefile to be compiled.
.PP 
It will also create an include directory containing a 'my.h' file with the prototypes of every function found in the C files. If any other .h file if found in 'include' file, all will be included in the 'my.h', so you wont have to include them anymore on your others C files. Moreover, it will look for a libmy.a library and link it if found.
.PP
-update	Looks for an update, and downloads it.
.PP
--install-man Installs his manual entry.

.SH ERRORS
Any files not located into the current directory or the lib directory won't be part of the protoypes, but still will be linked into the Makefile.
.PP
On update, if the network appears to be not reachable, the program will print an error and exit.
.PP
If not enought rights are given to the bash file, commands will probably fail, and errors will be printed.
