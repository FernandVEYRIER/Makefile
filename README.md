Makefile.sh
===========

This bash script creates a Makefile compiling with all the C code files found recursively, and a my.h in a lib directory with all the prototypes of the functions. It also includes the others .h files in the first one, so you just have to include "my.h" in all your files.
-update command allows you to get the last version of the script
Usage : [bin name] [-update]
